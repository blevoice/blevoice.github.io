## 1. Introduction

The On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) standard, which has been in use for decades, is still in operation today. Many engineers have recognized that this standard is outdated, but since it has been adopted for so many years and has become an industry standard, OBD will continue to be used.

- **Vehicle Computer Data Display**: The OBD interface can provide various operational data from the vehicle, such as data displayed on the dashboard, fuel consumption records, battery voltage, air-fuel ratio, throttle position, knock sensor count, and more.
- **Fault Code Reading**: The OBD interface can be used to read fault codes, which helps quickly diagnose vehicle issues, reducing manual diagnosis time.
- **Code Modification for More Functions**: By connecting the OBD data line to the vehicle's CAN bus and adjusting the code of various modules, it is possible to unlock numerous "hidden" features, effectively enabling "upgrade" or "customization" options.
- **Reading and Writing ECU/TCU Programs**: This allows manufacturers to update ECU control programs at any time. However, it is not recommended for users to modify this themselves.

## 2. Detailed Description

### 2.1 The Composition of OBD and the Minimum System for Bluetooth Chips

This section describes the typical PCBA (Printed Circuit Board Assembly) structure of an OBD system.

### 2.2 Complete OBD Composition

This is the typical PCBA structure for a standard in-vehicle OBD system.

The Bluetooth chip used in this system is the KT6368A, which is a dual-mode chip supporting SPP (Serial Port Profile) and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).

Moreover, a large number of application apps are available in both the iOS App Store and Android App Market.

Whether the product is a generic version or a customized product, the KT6368A dual-mode Bluetooth chip can be used for development. It offers a low cost and stable performance.

### 2.3 Peripheral System of KT6368A
